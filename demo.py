"""Five sources on one question. Two are the same article. They disagree.

    python demo.py

Two failures that a research agent has to survive, shown together:

  1. Republished copies inflate corroboration. The same wire story on three
     sites is one source, not three, and counting it as three turns a single
     claim into a consensus.
  2. Sources disagree. An agent that picks one and reports it confidently has
     destroyed the only information the user needed.

No network, no model: the fetched pages are written here so deduplication
and corroboration can be watched on their own.
